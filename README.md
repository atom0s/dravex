# dravex

**dravex**, short for `Dungeon Runners Asset Viewer and Extractor`, is an asset viewer and extractor tool for the now-discontinued MMORPG, Dungeon Runners. **dravex** allows you to open and parse the games `game.pki` and `game.pkg` files which contains the games various data files such as textures, fonts, objects, map information, configurations, and more.

**dravex** supports the following client versions:

  - **v118**
  - **v666**

_**Note:** dravex supports these two main client versions, however, support for any other version is most likely valid and works as-is without needing to edit anything in dravex. If you have a client version that is not listed here, please contact atom0s directly to have it validated and/or have support added if need be!_

## Building dravex

**dravex** is built using **VSCode**, **CMake** and **vcpkg** as the main tooling. For third-party libraries that are maintained outside of this repository, **vcpkg** is generally used. This includes things such as `zlib`.

You will need to install the various requirements for this project with the following commands:

```
vcpkg install zlib
```

Because of issues with some versions of Windows, Powershell and vcpkg, you may need to adjust/tweak paths for your system.

You can find overrides for working with zlib and vcpkg inside of the `CMakeLists.txt` file near the top of the file:

```
# Define the toolchain to use vcpkg..
set(CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE "Z:/SourceCode/deps/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" CACHE STRING "Vcpkg toolchain file")
set(Z_VCPKG_BUILTIN_POWERSHELL_PATH "C:/Program Files/Powershell/7/pwsh.exe")
```

_This is currently setup to match my personal build environment and system setup due to said bugs._

Once you have all requirements and such installed and configured, you can use the VSCode CMake toolbar at the bottom of the window to select the desired build, presets, and targets to build **dravex**.
